# 👋 Hi, I'm Lluís

## 🛠 Technical skills

I mainly work with C, C#, and Python. I also have some experience with R and MATLAB.  
My background is in biomedical engineering, and I particularly enjoy problems that involve mathematics, medical data, or electronics.

## 🏃 Hobbies

Sports have always been part of my life. I’ve played basketball since I was eight years old and spent several years as team captain. I enjoy trying new sports, and over time I’ve gravitated toward martial arts and, more recently, climbing walls. Every now and then, I like playing chess with friends or family.

I strongly enjoy social events at university such as hackathons, meetings, events... 

This is me with Xavier Verdaguer.

## 🌍 Interests

I’m deeply interested in humanities, economics, and psychology, especially where they intersect. I enjoy long conversations about how people think, how societies function, and why decisions are made the way they are. Film and storytelling are another strong interest, both as a way to explore perspectives and as a craft in themselves. Travelling is also important to me: discovering different cultures, spending time in nature, and exploring food are some of the ways I stay curious about the world.

During second course I was able to take a mobility program at Belgium, check it out:

## 🧠 Personality

Curiosity defines me. I like experimenting, learning new things, and stepping into unfamiliar domains. I’m energetic and enjoy talking to people who are genuinely passionate about what they do.

## 🎙 Hear me talking

I enjoy discussing ideas in a conversational format, especially around technology, engineering, psychology, and society. I like spaces where curiosity and critical thinking drive the conversation.
