# 👋 Hi, I'm Lluís

## 🛠 Technical skills

I mainly work with C, C#, and Python. I also have some experience with R and MATLAB.  
My background is in biomedical engineering, and I particularly enjoy problems that involve mathematics, medical data, or electronics.

## 🤝 Soft skills

I’m comfortable working autonomously.

I’m used to problem-solving under uncertainty. When information is incomplete or constraints change, I focus on understanding the problem, testing assumptions, and iterating toward practical solutions rather than waiting for perfect conditions.

Communication and reliability matter a lot to me. I try to be clear, honest, and direct when sharing ideas or progress, and I take commitments seriously. If I say I’ll do something, I make sure it gets done.

## 🏃 Hobbies

Sports have always been part of my life. I’ve played basketball since I was eight years old and spent several years as team captain. I enjoy trying new sports, and over time I’ve gravitated toward martial arts and, more recently, climbing walls. Every now and then, I like playing chess with friends or family.

I strongly enjoy social events at university such as hackathons, meetings, events... 

This is me with Xavier Verdaguer.

## 🌍 Interests

I’m very interested in recent advances in AI, chips and robotics. I enjoy conversations about humanities, economics and psychology. Film and storytelling are another strong interest. I try to travel whenever I have free time, I like discovering different cultures, spending time in nature, and exploring food.

During second course I was able to take a mobility program at Belgium, check it out:

We studied VR implementing IMUs, ROS communication...

## 🧠 Personality

Curiosity defines me. I like experimenting, learning new things, and stepping into unfamiliar domains. I’m energetic and enjoy talking to people who are genuinely passionate about what they do.

## 🎙 Hear me talking

I enjoy discussing ideas, especially around technology, engineering, psychology, and society. I believe communication is a strong asset of mine.
